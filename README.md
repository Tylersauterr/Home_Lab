# 🏠 Tyler's Personal Home Lab

Welcome to my personal home lab project.

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and ongoing projects I build using my headless Ubuntu-based server. It was created as a space for learning, experimenting, and growing my skills in **cybersecurity**, **system administration**, and **network engineering**.

## 📚 Why I Built This

As a cybersecurity student and aspiring sysadmin, I wanted to create a dedicated lab to:
- Practice real-world skills in a private, secure environment
- Learn tools hands-on (not just theory)
- Prepare for internships and future roles in cybersec/IT

---

## 🛠️ Future Projects

This repo will grow to include:
- WireGuard VPN deployment
- SIEM/logging stack (e.g. ELK or Graylog)
- Vulnerability scanning tools (e.g. OpenVAS, Nmap, Nessus)
- Internal dashboards or monitoring tools
- Vulnerable VMs for ethical hacking and red team practice

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Tyler — a cybersecurity student who loves building things, breaking things, and understanding how systems work from the ground up.

This lab is my sandbox, and this repo is the record of that journey.
